# Authors

To differentiate between [:octocat: `Contributors`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Contributors/) the authors category is less broad:

- Only people who have directly contributed to a repository with a permanent contribution are included (issues in my repositories, along with all contributions in other repositories are not included. Source Code donations are listed separately)

## List

### Source code

- [:octocat: `@seanpm2001`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/) - Main author

### Graphic Design

- [:octocat: `@seanpm2001`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/) - Main author
- [:octocat: `@QamberHasnain`](https://github.com/Qamberhasnain/) - For creating the current URLL language logo

### Donations

> **Note** _This section will be split off eventually._
